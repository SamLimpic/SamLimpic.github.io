I've always had a passion for finding simple solutions to complex problems.  I have a knack for taking a daunting, complex task, breaking it down into its constituent pieces, and fitting each together in a logical manner.  The world of software development was a breath of fresh air to me, as I was able to channel that creative energy into engineering elegant answers to multi-faceted questions.

My background in the San Diego brewing industry has granted me an empathetic understanding of people from all walks of life, and I am able to channel that experience into an open, communicative work style.  I feel that understanding the needs of your peers in a professional setting is the bedrock of forming an effective team in any organization.  Open and honest communication is key to any industry, and software development is no different.

As a developer, I strive to strike a balance between logical problem solving and thoughtful communication, to ensure that my entire team can form an environment that naturally fosters success.
